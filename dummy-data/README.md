# How to use dummy data with SFDX

## Exporting with record types

Always add `RecordType.DeveloperName` to your SOQL query when exporting, if you want to keep the record type intact. A plugin is fixing the record type ID before it is imported to the new scratch org, so you won't have to do a single thing.

## Exporting data from an org

For exporting with lookups, the easiest method is to export the parent and use relationship queries. (e.g., `SELECT Name, RecordType.DeveloperName, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account`). This command will export your query:

```java
sfdx force:data:tree:export --query "SELECT [fields] FROM [sObject]" --outputdir dummy-data/[name] --plan
```

Use a name for the feature this data is suitable for, OR the name of the object.

Sometimes, you'll need to export from the child with numerous parents (many lookups).

-   For the child records
    -   `sfdx force:data:tree:export --query "SELECT [fields] FROM [child sObject]" --outputdir dummy-data/[name] --plan`
-   For the parents
    -   `sfdx force:data:tree:export --query "SELECT [fields] FROM [parent sObject 1]" --outputdir dummy-data/[name]` (remove --plan)
    -   `sfdx force:data:tree:export --query "SELECT [fields] FROM [parent sObject 2]" --outputdir dummy-data/[name]` (remove --plan)
    -   `sfdx force:data:tree:export --query "SELECT [fields] FROM [parent sObject 3]" --outputdir dummy-data/[name]` (remove --plan)

You'll then **_rename_** `dummy-data/[name]/[Child sObject]s-plan.json` to **ONLY be plan.json** (in the same folder). Then edit the file, and make sure each json file containing data is present in the plan. The plan.json file is the plan for what is imported.

```json
[
    {
        "sobject": "[Parent sObject]",
        "saveRefs": true,
        "resolveRefs": false,
        "files": ["[Parent sObject]s.json"]
    },
    {
        "sobject": "[Child sObject]",
        "saveRefs": false,
        "resolveRefs": true,
        "files": ["[Child sObject]s.json"]
    }
]
```

Because the json file containing data for the parent contains a `referenceId`, `saveRefs` is set to true for the parent above and `resolveRefs` is true for the child, you can have lookup relationships without actual IDs.

That means you'll have to edit `[Child sObject]s.json` (the data for the child records) to include the lookup by having `"[Parent sObject]": "@[Parent sObject]RefX"` (example below). Because `resolveRefs` is set to true on the child sObject, the SFDX import function automatically creates the lookup.

Example `myFeature-plan.json`:

```json
[
    {
        "sobject": "Account",
        "saveRefs": true,
        "resolveRefs": false,
        "files": ["myFeature-Accounts.json"]
    },
    {
        "sobject": "Case",
        "saveRefs": false,
        "resolveRefs": true,
        "files": ["myFeature-Cases.json"]
    }
]
```

Example `myFeature-Accounts.json`:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "attributes": {
                "type": "Account",
                "referenceId": "AccountRef1"
            },
            "BillingState": "Wyoming",
            "ShippingState": "Wyoming",
            "BillingCity": "Cheyenne",
            "ShippingCity": "Cheyenne",
            "Name": "Yadel"
        }
    ]
}
```

Example `myFeature-Cases.json`:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "attributes": {
                "type": "Case",
                "referenceId": "CaseRef1"
            },
            "Account": "@AccountRef1",
            "Name": "My first case"
        }
    ]
}
```

## File and folder structure

**ALWAYS** have dummy-data self-contained in its own folder, both for readability and avoiding overwriting existing data. If you want ALL scratch orgs to have your dummy data, add the data as `dummy-data/[name]/`, which contains ONE `plan.json` file and one or more `[sObjects].json` files, which are also referenced in the plan.sjon.

The init scripts for scratch org creation automatically find these `plan.sjon` files and imports them for you. If you don't want auto importing, have the `plan.sjon` file renamed to anything else, and it won't be imported.

## Importing dummy data

All data is automatically imported using the init scripts for macOS or Windows, as long as they follow the folder structures defined above. See `./scripts/mac/createScratchOrg.command` and `./scripts/windows/createScratchOrg.sh`.
